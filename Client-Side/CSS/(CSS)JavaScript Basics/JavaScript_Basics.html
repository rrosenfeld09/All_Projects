				<h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
				<p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reason.s It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it ina bunch of different directions. JavaScrip lives inside a host environment (a web broswer or Nody server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
				<ul>
					<li> <span>Variable Declaration</span> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique name. These unique names are called identifiers. <span><span>var x;</span></span></li>
					<li><span>Variable Assignment</span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span><span>var x = 10;</span></span></li>
					<li><span>Data Types</span> Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primities: Boolean - <span><span>true</span></span> or <span><span>false;</span></span> null - <span><span>null</span></span> aka nothing; Number - <span><span>42</span></span> or <span><span>3.1415</span></span>; String - <span><span>"Coding Dojo Rocks!"</span></span>; Array - <span><span>[1, 'Coding', 1, 'Dojo']</span></span>; and Object - <span><span>{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: 'Doe'}</span></span></li>
					<li><span>Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks bas on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statments in your code to accomplish this. There are the folliwng conditional statements: <span><span>if</span></span> a specified condition is tru, do this code in our code block; <span><span>else if</span></span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span><span>else</span></span> we execute this block of code;</li>
					<li><span>Loops</span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
					<li><span>Function</span> Functions are an encaspulation of a code block. When we call our functions this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruion manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Don! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our functions over and over and over again.</li>
